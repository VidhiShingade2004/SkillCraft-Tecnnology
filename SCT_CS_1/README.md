# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Text Encryption Tool

A simple yet elegant web-based tool that lets users **encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm**. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project visually demonstrates one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques in cryptography.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This tool allows users to input custom text and a shift value to either **encrypt** or **decrypt** their message in real-time.

This project demonstrates basic principles of:
- Cryptography (Classical Encryption)
- JavaScript string manipulation
- Interactive frontend UI/UX design

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🔤 Encrypts text using Caesar cipher with a custom shift value.
- 🔓 Decrypts the encrypted text back to the original.
- ✅ Input validation for shift range (1–25).
- 🎨 Clean and modern UI using HTML5 + CSS3.
- 🧠 Intelligent character preservation: spaces, numbers, and punctuation remain unaffected.
